  "summary": "The diff implements a new 'Current Rank' card on the DashboardPage that shows the rank label with rank-specific color and glow styling derived from getRankFromLevel (from rankUtils.ts), placed in the stats overview grid alongside the existing Level, XP, Coins, and Unspent Points cards. The card is also clickable to open RankInfoDialog. All REQ-1 acceptance criteria appear to be met: rank box is visible on Dashboard, rank label is derived from user level via getRankFromLevel, rank label text uses rank-specific colors, visual style mirrors the existing stat cards, and it updates with the user's level since it reads from the same profile data.",
