  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json, but the content is truncated and the new discipline skills cannot be fully verified. More critically, the frontend SkillsPage.tsx file is not present in the diff at all, meaning REQ-2 appears unimplemented. The project_state.json still lists both AR-1 and AR-2 as 'pending', further suggesting neither requirement was completed.",

Each skill should include all required fields (id, name, description, category, stat requirements, level requirement, unlock status defaults).",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and no new discipline skill entries with all required fields are visible in the shown content. The project_state.json also marks this as pending.",
