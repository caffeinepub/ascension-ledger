  "summary": "The diff correctly updates `frontend/src/utils/rankUtils.ts` with all nine rank thresholds matching the specified level ranges. The `getRankFromLevel` function implements every boundary (60+, 50+, 40+, 30+, 20+, 15+, 10+, 5+, and default E Rank) as required. The DashboardPage summary confirms the RankBadge component imports and uses `getRankFromLevel`. All acceptance criteria appear satisfied. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were detected.",
