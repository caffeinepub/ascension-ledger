  "summary": "The implementation partially addresses the BuildRequest but has significant missing backend functionality. The frontend implements automatic refresh at midnight UTC (REQ-3), but the critical backend timer system for automatic daily task generation (REQ-1 and REQ-2) appears to be missing or not evident in the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement a backend timer system that triggers at 00:00:00 UTC daily to automatically generate AI tasks for all users",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff shows Timer import but no visible implementation of a daily timer that triggers at midnight UTC or automatic task generation logic. The truncated content does not show any timer setup, recurring timer callback, or midnight calculation logic.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the daily task generation system handles timezone-independent execution and persists tasks immediately upon generation",
      "reason": "No evidence of automatic task generation logic, error handling for failed generation, or immediate persistence of generated tasks in the visible backend code. The diff does not show any daily task generation workflow or error recovery mechanisms.",
