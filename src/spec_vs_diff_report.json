  "summary": "The diff implements a frontend Mission Log page (REQ-3) with today's summary statistics, but completely lacks the core backend automation requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4). There is no midnight timer mechanism, no automated mission log creation, no persistent historical log data structure, and no enhanced AI task generation logic based on user patterns.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement a daily timer mechanism that triggers at midnight (00:00:00 local time) to automatically generate new AI-recommended daily tasks",
      "reason": "No timer implementation found in backend/main.mo. While Timer is imported, there is no timer setup, no midnight trigger logic, no timezone handling, and no automatic task generation invocation.",

      "requirement": "Enhance the AI task generation logic to consider user's historical completion patterns, time of day preferences, and previously completed tasks to provide more personalized daily recommendations",
      "reason": "No evidence of AI task generation enhancement. No logic analyzing taskCompletionLog, no pattern recognition based on completion success rates, no repetition avoidance logic, and no difficulty scaling based on user level.",
