  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements. Backend functions for username update and account deletion are present with proper validation. Frontend implements username editing with inline edit mode, toast notifications, and profile refresh. Account deletion includes a detailed confirmation dialog with permanent data loss warning, proper logout, and error handling. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",

      "reason": "REQ-4 specifies 'logout and redirect to landing page after deletion', but the ProfileSettingsPage implementation shows logout and cache clearing without explicit redirect navigation to the landing page. The code calls clear() and queryClient.clear() but does not use navigate() or similar routing to redirect to the landing page.",
